<p>Here is an example of how to get and set keyboard mode.

<pre><code>#include &lt;linux/kd.h&gt;

</code></pre>

<h1 id="2-terminal-interface">2. Terminal Interface</h1>

<p>POSIX systems support two basic modes of input: canonical and noncanonical. [2]</p>

<p>In canonical input processing mode,
terminal input is processed in lines terminated by newline (’\n’), EOF, or EOL characters.
No input can be read until an entire line has been typed by the user,
and the read function returns at most a single line of input,
no matter how many bytes are requested.</p>

<p>In canonical input mode, the operating system provides input editing facilities:
some characters are interpreted specially to perform editing operations
within the current line of text, such as ERASE and KILL.</p>

<p>In noncanonical input processing mode, characters are not grouped into lines, and
ERASE and KILL processing is not performed. The granularity with which bytes are read in
noncanonical input mode is controlled by the MIN and TIME settings.</p>

<p>Most programs use canonical input mode, because this gives the user a way to edit
input line by line. The usual reason to use noncanonical mode is when the program accepts
single-character commands or provides its own editing facilities.</p>

<h2 id="terminal-modes">Terminal modes</h2>

<p>This section describes the various terminal attributes that control how input and output
are done. The functions, data structures, and symbolic constants are all declared in the
header file ‘termios.h’.</p>

<p>The entire collection of attributes of a terminal is stored in a structure of type <em>struct
termios</em>. This structure is used with the functions <em>tcgetattr</em> and <em>tcsetattr</em> to read and
set the attributes.</p>

flags.</p>

<p><strong>cc_t</strong> This is an unsigned integer type used to represent characters associated with various
terminal control functions.</p>

<h2 id="terminal-model-functions">Terminal Model functions</h2>
<pre><code>int tcgetattr (int filedes, struct termios *termios-p)
</code></pre>

<p>This function is used to examine the attributes of the terminal device with file descriptor
filedes. The attributes are returned in the structure that <em>termios-p</em> points to.</p>

<p>If successful, <strong>tcgetattr</strong> returns 0. A return value of <strong>-1</strong> indicates an error.
The following <em>errno</em> error conditions are defined for this function:</p>

<p><strong>EBADF</strong> The filedes argument is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p><strong>ENOTTY</strong> The filedes is not associated with a terminal.</p>
<pre><code>int tcsetattr (int filedes, int when, const struct termios *termios-p)
</code></pre>

<p>This function sets the attributes of the terminal device with file descriptor filedes.
The new attributes are taken from the structure that <em>termios-p</em> points to.
The when argument specifies how to deal with input and output already queued. It
can be one of the following values:</p>

<table>

<th>when</th>
<th>Remark</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>TCSANOW</td>
<td>Make the change immediately.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>TCSADRAIN</td>
<td>Make the change after waiting until all queued output has been written. You should usually use this option when changing parameters that affect output.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>TCSAFLUSH</td>
<td>This is like TCSADRAIN, but also discards any queued input.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>TCSASOFT</td>
<td>This is a flag bit that you can add to any of the above alternatives. Its meaning is to inhibit alteration of the state of the terminal hardware. It is a BSD extension; it is only supported on BSD systems and the GNU system. <br>Using TCSASOFT is exactly the same as setting the CIGNORE it in the c_cflag member of the structure <em>termios-p</em> points to.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>If this function is called from a background process on its controlling terminal,
normally all processes in the process group are sent a SIGTTOU signal, in the same way
as if the process were trying to write to the terminal. The exception is if the calling
process itself is ignoring or blocking SIGTTOU signals, in which case the operation is
performed and no signal is sent.</p>

<p>If successful, tcsetattr returns 0. A return value of -1 indicates an error. The
following errno error conditions are defined for this function:</p>

<p><strong>EBADF</strong> The filedes argument is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p><strong>ENOTTY</strong> The filedes is not associated with a terminal.</p>

<p><strong>EINVAL</strong> Either the value of the when argument is not valid, or there is something
wrong with the data in the termios-p argument.</p>

<p>Although <strong>tcgetattr</strong> and <strong>tcsetattr</strong> specify the terminal device with a file descriptor,
the attributes are those of the terminal device itself and not of the file descriptor. This
means that the effects of changing terminal attributes are persistent; if another process
opens the terminal file later on, it will see the changed attributes even though it doesn’t
have anything to do with the open file descriptor you originally specified in changing the
attributes.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a single process has multiple or duplicated file descriptors for the same
terminal device, changing the terminal attributes affects input and output to all of these
file descriptors. This means, for example, that you can’t open one file descriptor or stream
to read from a terminal in the normal line-buffered, echoed mode; and simultaneously
have another file descriptor for the same terminal that you use to read from it in singlecharacter,
non-echoed mode. Instead, you have to explicitly switch the terminal back and
forth between the two modes.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-terminal-mode">Set up Terminal Mode</h2>

<p>When you set terminal modes, you should call <strong>tcgetattr</strong> first to get the current modes of
the particular terminal device, modify only those modes that you are really interested in,
and store the result with <strong>tcsetattr</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s a bad idea to simply initialize a struct <em>termios</em> structure to a chosen set of attributes
and pass it directly to tcsetattr. Your program may be run years from now, on
systems that support members not documented in this manual. The way to avoid setting
these members to unreasonable values is to avoid changing them.</p>

<p>What’s more, different terminal devices may require different mode settings in order to
function properly. So you should avoid blindly copying attributes from one terminal device
to another.</p>

<p>When a member contains a collection of independent flags, as the c_iflag, c_oflag
and c_cflag members do, even setting the entire member is a bad idea, because particular
operating systems have their own flags. Instead, you should start with the current value
of the member and alter only the flags whose values matter in your program, leaving any
other flags unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="input-mode">Input Mode</h3>

<p>This section describes the terminal attribute flags that control fairly low-level aspects of
input processing: handling of parity errors, break signals, flow control, and RET and LFD
characters.</p>

<p>All of these flags are bits in the <strong>c_iflag</strong> member of the <em>struct termios</em> structure. The
member is an integer, and you change flags using the operators &amp;, | and ^. Don’t try to
specify the entire value for <strong>c_iflag</strong>—instead, change only specific flags and leave the rest
untouched.</p>

Thus, the program actually reads three bytes for one erroneous byte received from the terminal.<br>If a valid byte has the value 0377, and <strong>ISTRIP</strong> (see below) is not set, the program might confuse it with the prefix that marks a parity error. So a valid byte 0377 is passed to the program as two bytes, 0377 0377, in this case.</td>

<h3 id="noncanonical-input">Noncanonical Input</h3>

<p>In noncanonical input mode, the special editing characters such as ERASE and KILL are
ignored. The system facilities for the user to edit input are disabled in noncanonical mode,
so that all input characters (unless they are special for signal or flow-control purposes) are
passed to the application program exactly as typed. It is up to the application program to
give the user ways to edit the input, if appropriate.</p>

<p>Noncanonical mode offers special parameters called MIN and TIME for controlling
whether and how long to wait for input to be available. You can even use them to avoid
ever waiting—to return immediately with whatever input is available, or with no input.
The MIN and TIME are stored in elements of the <strong>c_cc</strong> array, which is a member of
the struct termios structure. Each element of this array has a particular role, and each
element has a symbolic constant that stands for the index of that element. VMIN and VMAX
are the names for the indices in the array of the <strong>MIN</strong> and <strong>TIME</strong> slots.</p>

<h4 id="int-vmin">int VMIN</h4>

<p>This is the subscript for the MIN slot in the c_cc array. Thus, termios.c_cc[VMIN]
is the value itself.</p>

<p>The MIN slot is only meaningful in noncanonical input mode; it specifies the minimum
number of bytes that must be available in the input queue in order for read to return.</p>

<h4 id="int-vtime">int VTIME</h4>

<p>This is the subscript for the TIME slot in the c<em>cc array. Thus, termios.c</em>
cc[VTIME] is the value itself.</p>

<p>The TIME slot is only meaningful in noncanonical input mode; it specifies how long
to wait for input before returning, in units of 0.1 seconds.
The MIN and TIME values interact to determine the criterion for when read should
return; their precise meanings depend on which of them are nonzero. There are four possible
cases:</p>

<h4 id="both-time-and-min-are-nonzero">Both TIME and MIN are nonzero.</h4>

<p>In this case, TIME specifies how long to wait after each input character to see if more
input arrives. After the first character received, read keeps waiting until either MIN
bytes have arrived in all, or TIME elapses with no further input.
read always blocks until the first character arrives, even if TIME elapses first. read
can return more than MIN characters if more than MIN happen to be in the queue.</p>

<h4 id="both-min-and-time-are-zero"> Both MIN and TIME are zero.</h4>

<p>In this case, read always returns immediately with as many characters as are available
in the queue, up to the number requested. If no input is immediately available, read
returns a value of zero.</p>

<h4 id="min-is-zero-but-time-has-a-nonzero-value">MIN is zero but TIME has a nonzero value.</h4>

<p>In this case, read waits for time TIME for input to become available; the availability
of a single byte is enough to satisfy the read request and cause read to return. When
it returns, it returns as many characters as are available, up to the number requested.
If no input is available before the timer expires, read returns a value of zero.</p>

<h4 id="time-is-zero-but-min-has-a-nonzero-value">TIME is zero but MIN has a nonzero value.</h4>

<p>In this case, read waits until at least MIN bytes are available in the queue. At that
time, read returns as many characters as are available, up to the number requested.
read can return more than MIN characters if more than MIN happen to be in the
queue.</p>

<p>What happens if MIN is 50 and you ask to read just 10 bytes? Normally, read waits until
there are 50 bytes in the buffer (or, more generally, the wait condition described above is
satisfied), and then reads 10 of them, leaving the other 40 buffered in the operating system
for a subsequent call to read.</p>

<p>Portability note: On some systems, the MIN and TIME slots are actually the same as
the EOF and EOL slots. This causes no serious problem because the MIN and TIME slots
are used only in noncanonical input and the EOF and EOL slots are used only in canonical
input, but it isn’t very clean. The GNU library allocates separate slots for these uses.</p>
